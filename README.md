Finch is ...

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html) (revisit), [Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) (revisit), and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (revisit).

Autoconf, Automake, and GNU Make are parts of the [GNU Build System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System). I [used]((https://github.com/donny/c-template) them in the past around six years ago. I was thinking to revisit and relearn these tools; and hopefully use them in future projects.
